Group #1 (Brent Misare, Perry Rodenbeck, Brett Schearer, Nick Zimkas)
Final Demo

This folder contains the simulations, code, and files used for the final demo.

The files are sorted into subfolders based on the type of code used. The subfolders are as follows:
      C++ Code:
            This is to be run on the Arduino.
            It handles the control, localization, i2c communication (slave), as well as the main finite state machine.
      Python Code:
            This is to be run on the Raspberry Pi.
            It handles the computer vison, system integration, and i2c communication (master).
      Matlab and Simulink:
            While this code is never run on the robot, it was critical in the creation of the C++ code.
            The folder contains simulations and block diagrams designed to obtain and tune values related to the feedback and control of the robot.
